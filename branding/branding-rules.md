# ArkIDE Branding Rules

- There are basicly none, just use the art respectfuly and do not make your own art of the charicter without giving credit to the original author, Insomnia64
- ***DO NOT MAKE INNAPROPRIATE ART OF ANY OF THE CHARICTERS, THAT WILL RESULT IN A BAN ON ARKIDE AND YOUR ART BEING REPORTED TO WHATEVER PLATFORM IT WAS MADE ON***
- You can add a chrismnas hat on top of the logos if the season is right, but thats it, dont add anything else to the logos and show them at a reasonable size on whatever your making them for to give credit.
